Plant_disease_detection Plant Disease Detection is a deep learning-based web application that identifies plant diseases from images. The model classifies leaves into three categories: Healthy, Powdery, and Rust to help farmers detect diseases early. 📌 Overview: Plant Disease Detection is a deep learning-based web application that identifies plant diseases from uploaded images. The model classifies plant leaves into three categories: ✅ Healthy ⚠️ Powdery (Powdery Mildew Disease) ❌ Rust (Rust Disease)
This project is built using Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and HTML/CSS to assist farmers and researchers in detecting plant diseases early and taking preventive measures.

🛠 Features: ✔ Upload an image of a plant leaf for disease detection. ✔ AI-based classification into three categories: Healthy, Powdery, and Rust. ✔ Web-based interface for easy accessibility. ✔ Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate predictions.

🏗 Tech Stack:
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
